# Invisible-Watermark

Invisible-Watermark is a steganography tool written in python that does not hide text data in an image's pixels but instead hides the text in the image itself.

Here is an example. Can you tell which is the original and which holds the watermark?

![Original](/assets/images/dog-original-.png) ![Watermarked](/assets/images/dog-watermarked-.png)

It's the second one that is watermarked but you would never know without being told.

Here is the text hidden in the second image.
